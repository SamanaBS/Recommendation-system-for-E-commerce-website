# Recommendation-system-for-E-commerce-website
A well developed recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention

I have designed two types of recommendation systems based on business context

Recommendation system: Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who bought items similar items

Recommendation system(search engine based): For a business without any user-item purchase history, a search engine based recommendation system can be designed for users. The product recommendations can be based on textual clustering analysis given in product description
